# GraphQL Test

I'm using a simple **JWT authentication** to make it easier to test the app. In a produccion app I would include a refresh token.

I also included an **env** file so you don't need to include your own or install the variables.

For the **database** I'm using [mongodb-memory-server.](https://github.com/nodkz/mongodb-memory-server)

For **batching** and **caching** I'm using [
Dataloader](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader).

The server runs on the default port (4000).
